# Capital-One-Hackathon-
Here, is the project created by my group for the Capital One Hackathon in Leicester.
The Theme of the project was the "Cost of Living Crisis" and so we made an information-based web application to help capital one users who are based in the UK, US and canada to locate the prices of goods and necessities in their cities and compare these prices to help navigate their spending.
